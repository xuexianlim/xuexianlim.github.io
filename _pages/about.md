Hello! I warmly welcome you to my pasture.ðŸŒ±
<br><br>
This is where I keep my reflections and ruminations about some of the fascinating stuff that I have explored throughout the past few years since I left junior college.
<br><br>
Feel free to graze on the projects that I've done at university. (I studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London and am currently broadening my knowledge in Robotics, Systems and Control at ETH ZÃ¼rich.)
<br><br>
Or perhaps the grass looks greener to you on the other side, in which case you should check out the hobbies that have made (and are still making) my life a lot more fun!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
