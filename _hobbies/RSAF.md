I underwent military aviation training in Australia and France on the Pilatus PC-21 and the Alenia Aermacchi M-346 respectively.

It remains one of the toughest things I ever did in my life. Military flying is stressful and unforgiving. I had my fair share of failed sorties and at times, came close to being attritted from the course. I even broke down in my OC's office during a debrief when I felt like my best efforts were not enough. But it was all worth it in the end when I received my pilot badge (colloquially known as wings). It was truly a moment of incredible jubilation and triumph.
