I dabble in a bit of pencil drawing and graphic design from time to time. These were self-taught so I'm by no means a professional in these. For graphic design, I use freeware/open source software as I do not have a subscription for Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. I use GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) for raster graphics and Inkscape for vector graphics.

One of the logos that I am very proud of designing is the one for the Women in MechEng society in Imperial College London. In 2020, there were a series of anonymous misogynistic remarks made on the Imperial Secrets Facebook page. The female students in the mechanical engineering cohort thus decided to create the Women in MechEng society as an all-inclusive group for people who were in support of female empowerment. The centrepiece of the logo can be interpreted as a female face and as a trophy, signifying the achievements of women in STEM. The gear has 20 teeth to commemorate the year in which the society was inaugurated. Finally, the bold and vibrant colours along with the dynamic swirls represent... the boldness, vibrance and dynamism of women in STEM.
