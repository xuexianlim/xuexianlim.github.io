I just wanted to share the video that my group did for an assignment for this module. The video talks about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)">anchoring cognitive bias</a>. Bear in mind that this was done during the COVID-19 lockdown and we each filmed our parts individually.
<br><br>
We collectively researched the topic and wrote down the content that was to be included in the video. When I first read the script, I thought that it was a little too dull so I volunteered to be the creative director. I edited the script to include a little more ✨𝓅𝒾𝓏𝓏𝒶𝓏𝓏✨. I also had to learn basic video editing and VFX skills to fulfill my creative vision but it really paid off beyond my expectations. My lecturer had to mute himself as he was laughing too hard while a few of my coursemates texted me to tell me that they really enjoyed the video.
<br><br>
Anyway, here's the video. Enjoy!
