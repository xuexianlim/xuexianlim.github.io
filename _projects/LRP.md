In the final year of my studies at Imperial College London, as part of the Professional Engineering Skills module, we had to conduct a literature review which would be assessed by our supervisor and an independent marker. We could indicate our top six preferences for the topic and the supervisor. The department then used their magical allocation algorithm to assign the topic and the supervisor in a supposedly Pareto optimal manner. I received my second preference which I was pretty happy about.
<br><br>
My supervisor was a Professor in Biomechatronics and he initially proposed a review of socially assistive robotics (SARs) for dementia patients. I however thought that the area had been sufficiently reviewed recently and proposed to review SARs for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), specifically in the area of communication and interpersonal skills. He agreed.
<br><br>
The review was limited to 30 pages so I had to be extremely concise with my explanations. A PDF of the final review can be found <a href="{{ 'LRP.pdf' | prepend: 'assets/pdf/' | relative_url}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here <i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i></a>. The biggest takeaway from this project is that we should be very critical with everything we read. Fancy figures and technical jargon are by no means a proxy for a well-conducted study. Some things appear really glossy on the surface but when held up to close scrutiny, the cracks start becoming apparent.

As a random aside, the display image for this project was updated post factum when I attended the open day for the Robotics Systems Lab at ETH ZÃ¼rich. I saw the <a href="https://www.aldebaran.com/en/pepper">Pepper</a> robot and recognised it as one of the robots in some of the reviewed studies.
