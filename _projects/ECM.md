The Embedded C for Microcontrollers module was my first foray into embedded programming. In this module, we used the <a href="https://www.mikroe.com/clicker-2-pic18fk">MikroE Clicker 2 for PIC18FK board</a>. My lab partner and I did some pretty nifty stuff and we even managed to win a little competition within the course (the goal of the competition was to program the coolest animation/game)!

    We took inspiration from somewhere.

The final project for the module was the development of an autonomous robot that could navigate a mine using a series of instructions coded in coloured cards. The robot had to be able to retrace its path to return to its starting position as well. The robot comprised of a <a href="https://www.mikroe.com/buggy">MikroE Buggy</a> along with a Clicker 2 board and a <a href="https://www.mikroe.com/color-click">MikroE Color Click board with a TCS3471 integrated color sensor</a>.
